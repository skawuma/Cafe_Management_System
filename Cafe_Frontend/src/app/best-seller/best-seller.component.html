                            leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
                            ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
                            A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>

                             when it comes to African cuisine, pilau is East Africa's ubiquitous rice dish and it often extends beyond its coastline from Zanzibar into the Indian Ocean islands such as Mauritius. 
                             Ugandan pilau has slight nuances from its Indian counterpart. Other pilau recipes will often include bay leaves, saffron, ground coriander seed, and turmeric, however,
                             Ugandan pilau recipes often use five distinct spices to make the pilau masala: black peppercorns, cloves, cumin, cardamom, and cinnamon..</p>
